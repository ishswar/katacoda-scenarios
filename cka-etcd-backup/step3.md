Create a backup

## etcdctl connection parameters

`etcdctl` is command line tool to manage etcd server and itâ€™s date.
Before we create a etcd backup we need to connect to running etcd server; as in case of kubernetes it is secured endpoint.
We need to know it's connection parameters.

** NOTE : this restore process is for a locally hosted etcd running in a static pod. **

We can find that using etcd pod's static manifest 

`cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml`{{execute}}

From above file we need 4 things :

1. etcd endpoint(s)
1. CA Certs file 
1. Client certificate 
1. Client certificate key

## Check connectivity 

Verify we're connecting to the right cluster...define your endpoints and keys

`
CACERT=$(cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml | grep peer-trusted-ca-file | cut -d= -f2)
CLIENT_KEY=$(cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml | grep peer-key-file | cut -d= -f2)
CLIENT_CERT=$(cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml | grep peer-cert-file | cut -d= -f2)
ENDPOINTS=$(cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml | grep listen-client-urls | cut -d= -f2)

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints $ENDPOINTS --cacert $CACERT --cert $CLIENT_CERT --key $CLIENT_KEY \
   member list
`{{execute}}

## Take a backup 

Lets take a backup - we are saving backup named 'snapshot.db' in current directory 

`
CACERT=$(cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml | grep peer-trusted-ca-file | cut -d= -f2)
CLIENT_KEY=$(cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml | grep peer-key-file | cut -d= -f2)
CLIENT_CERT=$(cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml | grep peer-cert-file | cut -d= -f2)
ENDPOINTS=$(cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml | grep listen-client-urls | cut -d= -f2)

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints $ENDPOINTS snapshot save snapshot.db --cacert $CACERT --cert $CLIENT_CERT --key $CLIENT_KEY
`{{execute}}

## Check a backup (We need to make sure backup is good)

Read the metadata from the backup/snapshot to print out the snapshot's status 

`ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --write-out=table snapshot status snapshot.db`{{execute}}
