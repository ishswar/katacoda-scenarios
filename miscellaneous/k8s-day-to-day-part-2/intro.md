Let's get our first look at the Kubernetes cluster - first we will create a cluster and slowly we will dip our toes in vast ocean of kuberntes.

In this scenario we will perform these steps to learn k8s

1. Create k8s cluster using kubeadm
1. Review kube configuration file
1. Go over few basic kubectl commandskubeadm & kubectl is pre-installed on machine  
1. Go over components on Kubernetes (look for them)
1. Deploy our Python app to cluster
