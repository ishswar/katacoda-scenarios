There are bunch of scenarios that you need to solve/perform during CKAD (based on 1.18)

This practice exam is based around the publicly available CKAD exam
curriculum. I cannot and won't share specific questions from the real
exam, it's simply a set of questions I've put together based on talking to
people who are taking the exam. I cannot and will not help you cheat.
